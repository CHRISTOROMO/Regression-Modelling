# Football Prediction Model
## 1. Defining the Question

### a) Specifying the Question
To develop a model that can predict the outcome of a game between team 1 and team 2 based on who is at home and who is away, as well as whether the game is friendly and the team's rankings.

### b) Defining the Metric for Success
The project will be considered a success if the models created are able to predict results of a game to an accuracy above 70%

### c) Understanding the context
The men's FIFA World Ranking is a ranking system for men's national teams in association football, currently led by Brazil. The teams of the men's member nations of FIFA, football's world governing body, are ranked based on their game results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. The rankings were introduced in December 1992, and eight teams (Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain) have held the top position, of which Brazil have spent the longest ranked first.

A points system is used, with points being awarded based on the results of all FIFA-recognised full international matches. The ranking system has been revamped on several occasions, generally responding to criticism that the preceding calculation method did not effectively reflect the relative strengths of the national teams. Since 16 August 2018, the current version of the ranking system has adopted the Elo rating system used in chess and Go.

The ranking is currently sponsored by Coca-Cola; as such, The FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking name is also used. Coca-Cola also sponsors its women's counterpart.

### d) Recording the Experimental Design
We will use exploratory data analysis, such as Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis, in this study to determine the relationships and differences between different variables. We'll also use polynomial and logistic regression to develop models.

### e) Data Relevance
We'll shall use two datasets which can be found here https://bit.ly/3ryAJR7

Our datasets contain information on football rankings through time and are thus useful for building a model that will be used to forecast the outcome of a game between team 1 and team 2 based on who is at home and who is away, as well as whether the game is friendly while reviewing the team's rankings.
